# appsignal-cli

Rust CLI for interacting with AppSignal. Binary name is `appsignal-cli` (not
`appsignal`, to avoid conflicts with the AppSignal Ruby gem).

## Architecture

```
src/
  main.rs              CLI entrypoint, clap derive command/subcommand definitions + dispatch
  config.rs            Config load/save (~/.config/appsignal/config.toml or project .appsignal.toml)
  api.rs               AppSignalClient — GraphQL + REST v2 client for the AppSignal API
  appsignal_url.rs     Parse AppSignal incident/sample URLs, paths, and bare sample ids
  sample_analysis.rs   Distil a Sample into the investigator digest (breakdown, N+1, slow queries, error trail)
  sample_cache.rs      Best-effort on-disk cache of fetched samples (dirs cache dir) + list/search/clear
  oauth.rs             OAuth PKCE flow (code verifier, challenge, token exchange, refresh)
  output.rs            Render trait, print()/print_with(), table()/detail()/json_line(), status! macro

  telemetry.rs         Best-effort per-command telemetry (TelemetryCommand enum + track_command)
  version_check.rs     Startup GitHub release check (warn on minor/patch, block on new major)
  client_headers.rs    Shared User-Agent + X-AppSignal-Client request headers
  commands/
    mod.rs             Shared helpers (resolve_org, authenticated_client) + re-exports
    about.rs           about — splash overview (version, config, auth, next commands)
    auth.rs            auth login / logout / status (OAuth only)
    apps.rs            apps list / info / find / set-org / show-org / resources <section>
    project.rs         project init (create/update project-local .appsignal.toml)
    incidents.rs       incidents list / list-exceptions / list-performance / list-anomalies / show / update / add-note
    samples.rs         samples show / list (transaction samples behind an incident)
    metrics.rs         metrics list / timeseries / history (GraphQL metric keys, timeseries, time-detective datapoints)
    performance.rs     performance actions / queries (rank slow performance incidents; drill into slow queries via samples)
    dashboards.rs      dashboards list / create / update
    triggers.rs        triggers list / create / update / archive (anomaly detection triggers)
    logs/
      mod.rs           logs tail / search / views / sources (REST log lines + GraphQL metadata)
      actions.rs       logs metrics + logs triggers (log-line action CRUD)
    skill.rs           skill install / update / status (bundled AppSignal skills for OpenCode, Codex, Claude)
```

- **CLI framework**: clap v4 with derive macros
- **HTTP client**: reqwest v0.12 with JSON + rustls-tls
- **Async runtime**: tokio
- **Error handling**: anyhow with contextual messages
- **Config format**: TOML via the `toml` crate
- **Config location**: `~/.config/appsignal/config.toml` (via `dirs` crate)
- **Time handling**: chrono for UTC timestamps in log tailing/pagination
- **Testing**: wiremock for HTTP mocking, tempfile for config tests

## Rust Workflow

- Before committing Rust changes, run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`.
- Prefer enums over free-form `String` values when the API exposes a small known
  domain, especially for GraphQL/JSON fields like `state`, `kind`, or `source`.
  Use serde renames like `#[serde(rename_all = "SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE")]` when
  the wire format is enum-shaped.
- In command-layer response/view models, prefer owned `String`/`Vec<T>` data over
  adding fresh lifetimes just to avoid small clones. Keep borrowing where it is
  already entrenched, but new code should default to the simpler owned shape.
- When adding new user-facing CLI commands or new server endpoints for CLI
  features, preserve the minimal CLI telemetry flow so command runs still emit
  the dedicated telemetry event and any new endpoint continues to send the
  standard CLI headers.

## Output and errors

- Command **results** are printed through `output::print()` / `output::print_with()`
  (stdout). JSON falls out of `Serialize` for free; only the human view is
  hand-written via a `Render` impl or a closure. Compose tables with
  `output::table()` and key/value panels with `output::detail()`.
- **Status messages** (progress, prompts, "OK", boxed notices) use the `status!`
  macro or `output::status_box()` and always go to stderr, so they never pollute
  `--output json`. `clippy.toml` bans `println!`/`print!`/`eprintln!`/`eprint!`
  to enforce this — route everything through `output`.
- Errors shown verbatim to the user must be a `CliError` (constructed directly,
  or installed as `.context(CliError::msg(...))` / `.context(CliError::from_http(...))`).
  Anything else is treated as internal and hidden behind a generic message
  unless `APPSIGNAL_CLI_DEBUG=1` is set. Add new user-facing messages as
  `CliError` variants or via `CliError::msg`, not as bare `anyhow!` strings.

## Adding a new command

End to end, a new subcommand usually touches:

1. `src/api.rs` — add the client method (and its private `*Data` response
   structs). Build the GraphQL query with correctly typed variables, assemble
   `vars` with `json!` + conditional inserts, call `self.graphql(...)`, and
   unwrap with a `CliError` context. Add a `wiremock` test.
2. `src/commands/<module>.rs` — add a `#[derive(Serialize)]` response type and a
   handler that does `Config::load` → `resolve_org` → `authenticated_client` →
   `resolve_app_id` → client call → `output::print_with(...)`.
3. `src/main.rs` — add the clap subcommand/action variant and the dispatch arm,
   **plus a `TelemetryCommand` variant and an `impl_telemetry_command!` arm**
   (the matches are exhaustive, so this is required to compile).
4. Docs + release — update `README.md`, this file's command tables, and the
   bundled skill in `skills/shared/body.md`, then add a changeset for
   user-facing changes.

## Git Workflow

- Prefer descriptive branch names. Avoid cliché names like `fix-bug` or `wip`, keep
  names longer than 3 characters, avoid leading/trailing punctuation, and do not
  use a ticket number as the whole branch name.
- Prefer rebasing feature branches instead of merging base branches back into
  them. Avoid local merge commits from `git pull`; use `git pull --rebase` (or a
  Git config like `pull.rebase=true` or `pull.ff=only`) instead.
- Do not leave `fixup!`, `squash!`, or amend-style commits in a branch that is
  ready for review. Autosquash them before pushing or merging.
- Write commit subjects in imperative mood, with a capitalized first letter,
  without trailing punctuation, and keep them under 50 characters.
- Do not use conventional-commit prefixes like `fix:` or `feat:` in the subject.
  Do not put ticket numbers, `[skip ci]`, or similar tags in the subject either;
  move that metadata into the commit body.
- Avoid vague subjects like `Fix bug`, `Update README`, or `WIP`. The subject
  should describe the actual change.
- Always include a commit body separated from the subject by a blank line.
  Explain why the change was needed, what was changed, and any important
  constraints or rejected alternatives.
- Do not put literal escaped newline sequences like `\n` in commit subjects or
  bodies. Pass multiple `-m` flags or otherwise write real newlines instead.
- Wrap commit body lines at 72 characters when practical. URLs may stay on one
  line.
- Put ticket references like `Closes #123` or `Related #123` in the body, not in
  the subject.
- Keep trailer lines like `Co-authored-by:` and `Signed-off-by:` at the end of
  the commit body.
- In this repo, when a code change does not need a user-facing changeset,
  include `[skip changeset]` in the commit body rather than the subject.

## AppSignal API

The CLI currently uses a mix of **GraphQL** and **REST v2** endpoints:

```text
GraphQL: POST https://appsignal.com/graphql
REST v2: https://appsignal.com/api/v2/...
```

The configured `endpoint` value is a base URL.
It defaults to `https://appsignal.com/`, and the client derives `/graphql` or
`/api/v2/...` paths from that base.

### Authentication

The CLI authenticates with **OAuth (PKCE)** by default. Access tokens are sent
via an `Authorization: Bearer` header and obtained through the OAuth
authorization code flow with PKCE.

The `AppSignalClient` struct stores an `AuthMethod` enum that determines how
each request is authenticated:
- GraphQL/REST with `AuthMethod::OAuth { access_token, .. }` → sets `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- GraphQL/REST with `AuthMethod::Token { token }` → appends a `?token=<token>` query parameter

**Headless token auth (additive).** A personal API token supplied via the global
`--api-token` flag or the `APPSIGNAL_API_TOKEN` environment variable takes
precedence over stored OAuth credentials and skips the OAuth refresh path
entirely. The flag value is recorded once at startup in a `OnceLock`
(`config::set_api_token_override`) so it reaches the single choke point,
`commands::authenticated_client`, without threading through every command;
`config::api_token()` resolves flag-then-env (see `config::resolve_api_token`).
Token auth is never persisted to disk — it is purely per-invocation — and OAuth
remains the default when no token is set. `auth status` and `about` report which
method is active.

### Key schema facts (learned the hard way)

- There is **no** `apps` root query. The root query type only has `app(id: ...)`
  for a single app and `organization(slug: ...)` for org-level access.
- Listing apps requires going through `organization(slug) { apps { ... } }`,
  which means the user must provide their **organization slug** (from the
  AppSignal URL: `appsignal.com/<org-slug>`).
- The `App` type has these known fields: `id`, `name`, `environment`, `status`,
  `createdAt`, `incidents`, `exceptionIncidents`, `performanceIncidents`,
  `anomalyIncidents`, `logIncidents`, `deployMarkers`, `metrics`, and more.
- `name` and `environment` are `NON_NULL String` on `App`.
- GraphQL errors are returned with HTTP 400, not in the `errors` array of a
  200 response. The client handles both cases.
- The GraphQL API does **not** expose `start`/`end` time range filters for
  incidents. The MCP server achieves this via direct MongoDB access.
- The GraphQL `state` filter only accepts a **single** `IncidentStateEnum`
  value, not a list (unlike the MCP server which supports comma-separated states).

### Incident types

`Incident` is a **GraphQL union** of four types:

- `ExceptionIncident` — error/exception incidents
- `PerformanceIncident` — slow action incidents
- `AnomalyIncident` — anomaly detection incidents
- `LogIncident` — log-based incidents

Common fields across all incident types:
- `id`, `number` (Int!), `state` (IncidentStateEnum), `severity` (IncidentSeverityEnum)
- `description`, `count` (Int!), `createdAt`, `lastOccurredAt`, `updatedAt`

Extra fields on `ExceptionIncident`:
- `exceptionName`, `exceptionMessage`, `actionNames`, `namespace`, `firstBacktraceLine`

Extra fields on `PerformanceIncident`:
- `actionNames`, `namespace`, `mean` (Float!), `totalDuration` (Float!)

Extra fields on `AnomalyIncident`:
- `alertState` (AlertStateEnum), `trigger` (Trigger object with `id`, `name`, `metricName`, `kind`)
- `tags` (list of `KeyStringValue` with `key` and `value`)

### Enums

- `IncidentStateEnum`: `OPEN`, `CLOSED`, `WIP`
- `IncidentOrderEnum`: `ID` (creation order), `LAST` (most recent activity)
- `AlertStateEnum`: `OPEN`, `CLOSED`, `WARMUP`, `COOLDOWN`, `UNTRACKED`, `ARCHIVED`

### Transaction samples

The raw per-request data behind an incident is reached through the incident:
`app(id).incident(incidentNumber).sample(...)` for one sample and
`.samples(start, end, limit)` for many. Because `incident` is a union,
the `sample`/`samples` fields are selected **inside** the
`... on PerformanceIncident` / `... on ExceptionIncident` fragments. The sample
type is taken from the returned `__typename`, never inferred from the input URL —
see `api.rs::get_incident_sample` and `appsignal_url.rs`.

- `sample(id: $id)` declares `$id: String`; `sample(timestamp: $at)` declares
  **`$at: DateTime`**, even though the value sent is an ISO-8601 *string*.
  `samples(start:, end:)` and `metrics.timeseries(start:, end:)` are the same —
  declaring the variable `String` returns an HTTP 400 type mismatch. This is the
  single most expensive footgun; the regression tests in `api.rs` assert the
  `DateTime` declaration is present.
- Performance samples carry `hasNPlusOne`, `timeline`, and `groupDurations`;
  exception samples carry `exception { name message backtrace }`, `errorCauses`,
  and `breadcrumbs`. Common fields: `id`, `action`, `namespace`, `duration`,
  `queueDuration`, `createdAt`, `revision`, `attributes`/`overview`/`environment`.
- Targeting the sample closest to a timestamp (`--at`) matters: the "latest"
  sample often hides the one that triggered the incident.
- `samples show` renders an investigator **digest** by default (see
  `sample_analysis.rs`): request overview + acting user, a per-group performance
  breakdown, slowest events/queries, N+1 detection (`hasNPlusOne` plus repeated
  timeline `digest`s), and for errors the exception, backtrace, causes, and
  breadcrumbs. `--output json` adds a structured `analysis` object alongside the
  raw `sample`; `--raw` prints the unprocessed sample instead. The analysis is
  pure and unit-tested on synthetic samples.
- `samples list` without `--incident` runs a **window scan**: the `incidents`
  query has no time-range filter, so `scan_samples_in_window` lists recent
  incidents (capped by `--limit`, default 20) and applies the window at the
  sample level. `--user` filters on the sample's user identity (see
  `sample_analysis::sample_user`, which also reads `sessionData`); `--namespaces`
  filters the incident list.
- Every fetched sample is also written to an on-disk cache (`sample_cache.rs`,
  one JSON file per sample under `dirs::cache_dir()/appsignal/samples/`) so
  `samples cache list`/`search` can re-inspect them offline. Caching is
  best-effort (never fatal) and additive — it does not change `show`/`list`
  output. Opt out per call with `--no-cache` or globally with `APPSIGNAL_NO_CACHE`.
  `search` matches the case-insensitive query against each entry's full
  serialized JSON, so it covers action, user, query bodies, params, and
  exceptions. Samples can hold sensitive data; `samples cache clear` wipes it.

### Metrics

Metrics are **GraphQL, not REST** — `app.metrics.keys(...)`,
`app.metrics.timeseries(...)`, and the app-level `timeDetectiveErrorDataPoints` /
`timeDetectivePerformanceDataPoints` fields cover every `metrics` subcommand. See
`api.rs::list_metric_keys`, `fetch_metric_timeseries`, and `fetch_time_detective`.

- `metrics.timeseries(start:, end:)` declares its window variables **`DateTime`**,
  same footgun as samples above. The `timeDetective*DataPoints(start:, end:)`
  fields go further and require **`DateTime!`** (non-null). Both have regression
  tests asserting the declaration.
- The `timeframe` argument (e.g. `R1H`, `R1D`) is a GraphQL **enum**, not a
  string. To avoid hard-coding its enum type name, `fetch_metric_timeseries`
  validates the value is alphanumeric and inlines it as a literal
  (`timeframe: R1H`) rather than passing it as a typed variable.
- Timeseries response field names come back **lowercased** on the wire (`mean`,
  `p95`, `counter`); deserialize accordingly.
- `metrics history` needs both `--start` and `--end`; `metrics timeseries` needs
  either `--timeframe` or both `--start`/`--end` (validated in `commands/metrics.rs`).

### Performance ranking

The `performance` command (see `commands/performance.rs`) is built entirely on
existing API surface — it does **not** add new GraphQL queries:

- `performance actions` calls `list_performance_incidents` (order `LAST`), then
  ranks the returned set **client-side** by `mean`, `totalDuration`, or `count`
  (the public API has no order-by-duration). `--limit` is the scan/rank depth.
- The public `performanceIncidents` data is **action-level**, not per-SQL. To get
  per-query timing, `performance queries` fetches each top action's latest sample
  (`get_incident_sample`, `SampleQuery::Latest`) and reuses `sample_analysis` to
  pull `slow_queries` / `n_plus_one_suspects` from the timeline. This is therefore
  derived from the latest sampled request per action, not a full aggregate — the
  human and JSON output both state this. A missing sample for an action is
  reported per-row, not fatal.
- New `Incident` accessors `namespace()`, `action_names()`, `mean()`, and
  `total_duration()` expose the performance-specific fields for ranking.

### Documented GraphQL queries from the AppSignal docs

Root query fields:

- `app(id: String!)` — single app by ID
- `organization(slug: String!)` — organization by slug
- `viewer` — authenticated user info including `organizations`

Key fields on `App`:
- `id`, `name`, `environment`
- `incidents(namespaces, marker, state, actionName, limit, offset, order)` — all incident types (union)
- `incident(incidentNumber: Int!)` — single incident by number (union)
- `exceptionIncidents(namespaces, marker, query, state, limit, offset, order, actionName)` — exception incidents only, with text search via `query`
- `performanceIncidents(namespaces, marker, query, state, limit, offset, order, actionName)`
- `anomalyIncidents(state, limit, offset, order)` — anomaly incidents only (fewer filters than exceptions)
- `logIncidents(state, limit, offset, order)`
- `deployMarkers(limit, offset, start, end)`
- `metrics { keys(...) }`, `metrics { timeseries(...) }`; `timeDetectiveErrorDataPoints(...)`, `timeDetectivePerformanceDataPoints(...)`
- `uptimeMonitors`

See https://docs.appsignal.com/api/graphql/examples.html for full examples.

There is also a legacy **REST API** at `https://appsignal.com/api/[app_id]/...` for:
- `/graphs.json` — graph data (mean, count, ex_count, ex_rate, pct)
- `/markers.json` — deploy markers
- `/samples.json` — transaction samples
- `/event_names.json` — event names
- `/sourcemaps` — sourcemap uploads

That legacy REST API uses the same `?token=` query parameter for auth (personal
tokens) or `Authorization: Bearer` header (OAuth tokens).

## Config

The global config file at `~/.config/appsignal/config.toml` stores:

- `org` — default organization slug (auto-saved by `apps list`, or set via `apps set-org`)
- `endpoint` — (optional) custom AppSignal base URL, defaults to `https://appsignal.com/`
- `oauth_client_id` — (optional) OAuth client ID override; defaults to the production client ID when unset
- `[oauth]` — OAuth credentials (set via `auth login`):
  - `access_token` — OAuth access token
  - `refresh_token` — OAuth refresh token (used for automatic renewal)
  - `expires_at` — UNIX timestamp when the access token expires
The org slug is used as a default for all commands that need an organization.
It can always be overridden with `--org <slug>`.

If the current directory (or one of its parents) contains `.appsignal.toml`, the
CLI uses that nearest local file as the only config for the project. Config
reads and writes go to the active file, so project-specific auth, endpoint, and
org settings stay isolated from the global config.

## OAuth

The CLI uses the **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow with PKCE** for browser-based
authentication. Implementation is in `src/oauth.rs`.

### Flow

1. CLI generates a PKCE code verifier + S256 challenge and a random state parameter
2. Opens the browser to `<oauth-base>/oauth/authorize` with PKCE and state params
3. User authorizes in the browser; server redirects to the configured callback URI
4. The CLI receives the callback automatically on `http://127.0.0.1:9789/callback`
5. CLI validates the state, then exchanges the code for tokens via `POST <oauth-base>/oauth/token`
6. Credentials are saved to `config.toml`

### Configuration

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Default client ID | `FpXP78S_vXNrjSRYQIMWQ9sREl2AXS0qD0VSWwfHST0` |
| Default redirect URI | `http://127.0.0.1:9789/callback` |
| Scopes | `user:read app:read app:write` |
| PKCE method | S256 |
| Grant types | `authorization_code`, `refresh_token` |

The OAuth base defaults to `https://appsignal.com` and is derived from `endpoint`
when a custom endpoint is configured, for example `https://staging.lol`.

The CLI uses the production OAuth client ID by default for all builds. To use a
staging-specific OAuth client, set `oauth_client_id` in `config.toml`.

The OAuth provider is Doorkeeper, configured in `appsignal-server`. The CLI
application is registered as a **non-confidential** (public) client — no client
secret is used.

### Token refresh

Before each API call, `commands::authenticated_client()` checks if the stored
OAuth access token has expired (with a 60-second grace window). If expired and
a refresh token is available, it automatically refreshes the token and persists
the updated credentials. If refresh fails, the user is prompted to re-authenticate.

### App resolution

All incident commands accept either:
- `--app-id <id>` — direct app ID (takes priority)
- `--app <name> --environment <env>` — look up app by name and environment within the saved org

The `--environment` flag is only needed when multiple apps share the same name
(e.g. "Weekmenu" in both "development" and "production").

### Incident listing options

Common options for `incidents list`, `list-exceptions`, `list-performance`, and `list-anomalies`:

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--app <name>` | App name (case-insensitive) |
| `--environment <env>` | Environment filter (e.g. "production") |
| `--app-id <id>` | App ID (alternative to --app) |
| `--org <slug>` | Organization (uses saved default if omitted) |
| `--limit <N>` | Max results (default: 10) |
| `--offset <N>` | Pagination offset |
| `--state <STATE>` | Filter by state: `OPEN`, `CLOSED`, or `WIP` |
| `--order <ORDER>` | Sort by: `LAST` (recent activity, default) or `ID` (creation) |

Additional options for `incidents list`, `list-exceptions`, and `list-performance`:

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--namespaces <ns>` | Filter by namespaces (comma-separated, e.g. "web,background") |
| `--action <name>` | Filter by action name (e.g. "UsersController#show") |

Additional option for `list-exceptions` and `list-performance`:

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--query <text>` | Text search for name or message |

### LLM workflow examples

**Finding the latest incident:**
```bash
# One-time setup: save the org slug from the current OAuth account
appsignal-cli apps list

# Get the latest incident
appsignal-cli incidents list --app "MyApp" --environment "production" --limit 1 --order LAST

# Get full details
appsignal-cli incidents show --number 42 --app "MyApp" --environment "production"
```

**Searching for a specific error:**
```bash
appsignal-cli incidents list-exceptions --app "MyApp" --environment "production" --query "TimeoutError" --state OPEN
```

**Searching for slow actions:**
```bash
appsignal-cli incidents list-performance --app "MyApp" --environment "production" --query "UsersController" --state OPEN
```

**Checking anomaly alerts:**
```bash
appsignal-cli incidents list-anomalies --app "MyApp" --environment "production" --state OPEN
```

**Filtering by namespace:**
```bash
appsignal-cli incidents list --app "MyApp" --environment "production" --namespaces "background" --state OPEN
```

**Closing an incident:**
```bash
appsignal-cli incidents update --number 42 --app "MyApp" --environment "production" --state CLOSED
```

**Triaging an incident with severity and a note:**
```bash
appsignal-cli incidents update --number 42 --app "MyApp" --environment "production" --severity CRITICAL
appsignal-cli incidents add-note --number 42 --app "MyApp" --environment "production" --content "Investigated: root cause is a memory leak in the connection pool."
```

## Logs

### Architecture

Log data lives in **ClickHouse** (not MongoDB). The AppSignal server has two paths
for querying logs:

1. **GraphQL** (`app.logs.lines`) — deprecated and removed server-side.
2. **REST API** (`POST /api/v2/logs/lines`) — used by the CLI for `logs search`
   and `logs tail`. Supports cursor-based pagination and SSE streaming.

The CLI still uses GraphQL for `logs views` and `logs sources` metadata.

### Key log types

**`LogLine`** — a single log entry:
- `id` (String!) — UUID
- `timestamp` (PreciseDateTime!) — ISO 8601
- `severity` (SeverityEnum!) — UNKNOWN, TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, NOTICE, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL, ALERT, FATAL
- `hostname` (String!) — originating host
- `group` (String) — log group (e.g. "notifiers", "background")
- `message` (String!) — the log message body
- `attributes` ([KeyStringValue]) — key-value metadata
- `source` (Source) — which log source (lazy-loaded)

**`LogView`** — a saved filter preset:
- `id`, `name`, `query` (free-text search), `sourceIds`, `severities`, `columns`, `lineHeight`

**`LogSource`** — a log ingestion source:
- `id`, `name`, `type` (vector/custom/vercel), `fmt` (JSON/PLAINTEXT/LOGFMT/AUTODETECT), `key`

### Queries used

```graphql
# Fetch log views
app(id: $appId) {
  logViews { id name query sourceIds severities columns }
}

# Fetch single log view by ID
app(id: $appId) {
  logView(id: $viewId) { id name query sourceIds severities columns }
}

# Fetch log sources
app(id: $appId) {
  logs {
    sources { id name type fmt }
  }
}
```

```json
// Fetch log lines
POST /api/v2/logs/lines
{
  "site_id": "app-id",
  "from": "2025-06-01T00:00:00Z",
  "to": "2025-06-01T01:00:00Z",
  "source_ids": ["source-1"],
  "query": "message:timeout severity=[error]",
  "pagination": {
    "per_page": 100,
    "order": "desc",
    "cursor": { "time": null }
  }
}
```

### Query syntax

The `query` parameter supports a rich filter syntax parsed by the ClickHouse BulkEndpoint
Rust service. Full docs: https://docs.appsignal.com/logging/query-syntax

#### Operators

| Operator | Syntax | Meaning | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|---------|
| `=` | `field=value` | Exact match | `group=notifiers`, `severity=error` |
| `!=` | `field!=value` | Not equal | `source!=mongodb` |
| `:` | `field:value` | Contains (substring) | `message:timeout`, `hostname:prod` |
| `!:` | `field!:value` | Does not contain | `hostname!:test` |
| `>` `<` `>=` `<=` | `field>value` | Numeric comparison | `duration>100` |

#### Available fields

`severity`, `hostname`, `group`, `message`, plus any custom attribute (dot notation
for nested: `user.id=123`).

#### Free text

Bare words (no field prefix) search the `message` field: `timeout` finds messages
containing "timeout".

#### Combining

- **Spaces** = implicit AND: `severity=error hostname=web-1`
- **`OR`** keyword: `severity=error OR severity=warning`
- **Parentheses**: `severity=error AND (hostname=web-1 OR hostname=web-2)`

#### Quoting

Use quotes for values with spaces or special characters: `group:"background jobs"`,
`message:"[Email]"`.

**IMPORTANT**: Square brackets `[...]` have special meaning (list/array syntax in
the legacy query parser). If you want to search for a literal `[Email]` in messages,
you MUST use `message:"[Email]"` — NOT `[Email]` as bare text.

**Correct**: `group=notifiers message:"[Email]"`
**Wrong**: `group=notifiers [Email]` (the `[Email]` gets parsed as a list, matching
any line containing the word "email" case-insensitively, not the literal `[Email]` prefix)

#### Severities

The CLI merges the `--severities` flag into the REST query string as
`severity=[error,critical]`. Using the flag is preferred over embedding
severity filters manually in `--query`.

### Log view resolution

The `--view` flag on `tail` and `search` resolves a log view by:
1. Trying the value as a **view ID** via `get_log_view(app_id, view_id)`
2. If that fails, listing all views and matching **by name** (case-insensitive)
3. Errors if no match or multiple matches

The view's `query`, `sourceIds`, and `severities` are applied as defaults.
Explicit CLI flags (`--query`, `--severities`, `--source-ids`) always override
the view's values.

### Pagination (`--page-all`)

The REST `POST /api/v2/logs/lines` endpoint is still queried in pages of 100.
The `--page-all` flag on `logs search` iterates through those pages using the
timestamp cursor:

1. Fetch 100 lines in **ASC** order (oldest first)
2. If the page is full (100 results), use the **last line's timestamp** as the
   next page cursor
3. **Deduplicate by log line ID** using a `HashSet` — multiple lines can share
   the exact same timestamp, so the boundary between pages may include duplicates
4. Stop when a page returns fewer than 100 results

This is implemented in `fetch_all_pages()` in `commands/logs.rs`.

Progress is printed to stderr: `Page N: fetched X lines (Y total unique)`.

### Tailing (`logs tail`)

Live log tailing currently uses the REST log query endpoint with **polling**
(not SSE yet):

1. Start with a 60-second lookback window
2. Every **1 second**, query for lines between `start` and `now` in ASC order
3. Deduplicate by ID using a `HashSet`
4. Move the window forward: next `start` = `now - 120 seconds` (2-minute lookback for safety)
5. Prune the seen-ID set when it exceeds 1000 entries (re-seed from current batch)

This matches the frontend's live tail behavior in `useLogTail.js`.

### CLI commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `logs tail [filters]` | Real-time log streaming (1s poll interval) |
| `logs search [filters] [--page-all]` | One-shot log query |
| `logs views` | List saved log views for an app |
| `logs sources` | List log sources for an app |

Filter flags (shared by `tail` and `search`):
- `--query <text>` — free-text search with field filter syntax
- `--severities <list>` — comma-separated (e.g. `ERROR,CRITICAL`)
- `--source-ids <list>` — comma-separated source IDs
- `--view <name-or-id>` — apply a saved log view's filters

Additional flags for `search`:
- `--start <ISO8601>` — start time
- `--end <ISO8601>` — end time
- `--limit <N>` — max results (default 100, max 100)
- `--order <ASC|DESC>` — sort order (default DESC)
- `--output <human|json>` — global result format for programmatic/LLM consumption
- `--page-all` — auto-paginate to fetch all results (ignores --limit/--order)

### LLM workflow examples

**Search for recent errors:**
```bash
appsignal-cli --output json logs search --app "MyApp" --environment "production" \
  --severities ERROR,CRITICAL
```

**Count emails sent in a time window:**
```bash
appsignal-cli --output json logs search --app "appsignal" --environment "production" \
  --query "group:notifiers [Email]" \
  --start "2025-03-16T06:53:00Z" --page-all
```

**Tail logs with a saved view:**
```bash
appsignal-cli logs tail --app "MyApp" --environment "production" --view "Error logs"
```

**Get log sources to use as filter:**
```bash
appsignal-cli logs sources --app "MyApp" --environment "production"
# Then use a source ID:
appsignal-cli --output json logs search --app "MyApp" --environment "production" \
  --source-ids "636873bc14ad665402d297e2"
```

## Adding new GraphQL queries

When adding new fields to queries, **always verify the field exists** on the
type first. The AppSignal GraphQL schema is not publicly documented in full.
Use introspection queries to discover available fields:

```graphql
{
  __type(name: "App") {
    fields {
      name
      type { name kind }
      args { name type { name kind } }
    }
  }
}
```

The GraphQL endpoint returns HTTP 400 with error details for invalid fields,
which makes it easy to iterate, but avoid guessing field names in production
queries.

### Known GraphQL limitations vs MCP server

The MCP server (`devenv/appsignal-server/app/mcp/tools/`) has direct MongoDB
access, giving it capabilities the GraphQL API does not expose:

- **Time range filters** (`start`/`end`) on incident queries — not available in GraphQL
- **Multiple state filters** (comma-separated) — GraphQL only accepts a single enum value
- **Trigger ID filter** on anomaly incidents — not available in GraphQL
- **Incident mutations** (update state/severity/assignees, create notes) — need to discover GraphQL mutations
- **Metrics REST API** — metric names, tags, timeseries, and aggregations use a separate REST API (`/api/v2/metrics/...`)
- **Log views/sources metadata** — still GraphQL-backed; there is no documented v2 REST
  replacement for `logs views` or `logs sources` yet.

See `TODO.md` for the full feature parity tracking document.
